To understand the spreading of disease of networks, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of networks and their behavior. The following chapter is going to focus on the theory of networks and give some insights on other interesting topics.
\subsection{Network Basics}
The mathematical representation of a network is a graph, a schematically drawing of such a construct is shown in figure \ref{fig:simpleNetwork}. The so called graph theory is a branch of mathematics which studies graphs, which are made up of nodes and edges (or links), the connections between the nodes.
\paragraph{Adjacency Matrix}
In order to describe the links between the nodes, the so called adjacency matrix is being used. Following \citep{BAR16} it's entries $a_{ij}$ are either one or zero depending on the existence of a link from node $j$ to node $i$. Note that this contradicts the convention of graph theory where the entries $a_{ij}$ of the adjacency matrix are 1, if there is an edge from node $i$ to node $j$.

\caption{The picture shows  a simple example of a network with 6 Nodes. The arrows are showing the connections (links) between the different nodes. Some of the links are unidirectional, others bidirectional.}
\label{fig:simpleNetwork}
\end{figure}
Following this concept the adjacency matrix for the network in figure \ref{fig:simpleNetwork} looks as follows:
\begin{equation}
A = \left( \begin{matrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{matrix}
 \right). \label{eq:adjMatExamp}
\end{equation}
Note that the entries $a_{ii}$ of $A$ are always $1$ (every node is connected to itself) and that the matrix would be symmetric if all links were bidirectional. 
If certain links were stronger then others, one would attach so called weights to the vertices. If the link represented by $a_{rs}$ had the strength (or weight) $85$, this would be represented by $a_{rs}= 85$. 
\paragraph{Reachability}
One way of determining if node $k$ is reachable by node $l$ in $n$ steps is taking the $n$th power of $A$ and inspecting it's entry $a_{nl}$. For example the 3rd power of matrix \ref{eq:adjMatExamp} would show that all nodes but nodes 6 are reachable by node 3 within 3 steps.
\paragraph{Disease Spread On Networks}
As shown in picture \ref{fig:disSpreadExampl}, a given disease can spread from one node to another in case there is a link between them. For example the disease can spread from node 3 to nodes 4 and 2 in the first time step. Node 1 will soon thereafter be infected by node 2, but not by node 4. If the structure of the network stays the same, node 6 will never be infected.

\subsection{Networks Of Stochastic Oscillators}
It is possible to analytically predict the behavior of a whole system of many nodes with a basic SIR-Model, as it was shown by \citep{ROZ11}. The system described by them was a network of $n$ cities which exposed a fix point. The fluctuations in the system could be described by a power spectrum derived from a Fokker-Planck equation. The eigenvalues of the system turn out to be quite close to the eigenvalues of a single city. The phenomenological explanation for this is that the cities behave like a single city, if the coupling and therefore the mixing is pretty strong. They behave like single cities, if the coupling is weak. Transferring this result on the case of BVD would imply that the stable state of the whole system would be close to the stable state of a single farm. The distributions for single farms can be found in chapter\ref{chap:rlDataRegulationGermany}.
