\subsection{Networks Of Stochastic Oscillators}
It is possible to analytically predict the behavior of a whole system of many nodes with a basic SIR-Model, as it was shown by \citep{ROZ11}. The system described by them was a network of $n$ cities which exposed a fix point. The fluctuations in the system could be described by a power spectrum derived from a Fokker-Planck equation. The eigenvalues of the system turn out to be quite close to the eigenvalues of a single city. The phenomenological explanation for this is that the cities behave like a single city, if the coupling and therefore the mixing is pretty strong. They behave like single cities, if the coupling is weak. Transferring this result on the case of BVD would imply that the stable state of the whole system would be close to the stable state of a single farm. The distribution of the different compartments of a single farm with PIs which have been in this farm for some time is the following:

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
No PIs
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $S= 79\,\%$
\item $I= 2\,\%$
\item $P= 0\,\%$ 
\item $R= 29\,\%$
    \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\linewidth}
PIs for a long time
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $S= 46\,\%$
\item $I= 6\,\%$
\item $P= 2\,\%$ 
\item $R= 46\,\%$
    \end{itemize}
