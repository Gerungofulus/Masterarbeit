	abstract = {The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems.},

abstract="The ubiquity of oscillations in epidemics presents a long standingchallenge for the formulation of epidemic models. Whether they areexternal and seasonally driven, or arise from the intrinsic dynamicsis an open problem. It is known that fixed time delays destabilize thesteady state solution of the standard SIRS model, giving rise tostable oscillations for certain parameters values. In thiscontribution, starting from the classical SIRS model, we make ageneral treatment of the recovery and loss of immunity terms. Wepresent oscillation diagrams (amplitude and period) in terms of theparameters of the model, showing how oscillations can be destabilizedby the shape of the distributions of the two characteristic(infectious and immune) times. The formulation is made in terms ofdelay equations which are both numerically integrated andlinearized. Results from simulations are included showing where theysupport the linear analysis and explaining why not where they donot. Considerations and comparison with real diseases are presentedalong.",
