\subsubsection{SIS-Model}
SIS-Models (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible-Models) are an another type of compartmental models. The use of this kind of model can be manifold. It can be used for disease such as bacterial infections, or some viruses, or parasites such as lice. For example \citep{BEL16} used this kind of model to describe a system of patients of hospitals where infected people could also "leave"\ the system while being replaced by new Susceptibles immediately. For virus infections like the flu it might be more realistic to use a SIRS-Model. A comprehensive comparison between the SIR and SIS model can be found in \citep{jacquez1993stochastic}.
