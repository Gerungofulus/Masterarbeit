\subsubsection{SIS-Model}
SIS-Models (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible-Models) are an another type of compartmental models. The use of this kind of model can be manifold. It can be used for disease such as bacterial infections, or some viruses, but it can also used for other models. For example \citep{BEL16} used this kind of model to describe a system of patients of hospitals where infected people could also \glqq leave\grqq the system while being replaced by new Susceptibles immediately. For virus infections like the flu it might be more realistic to use an SIRS-Model.
