\chapter{Theoretical Modeling of Disease Dynamics} 
This chapter gives an introduction to the basics of modeling of disease dynamics and the specific model used for this thesis. Chapter \ref{chap:generalModeling} describes the more general models, chapter \ref{chap:bvdModel} describes the specific compartmental model used to simulate BVD, chapter \ref{chap:networksBasics} gives an introduction to networks and interesting ways of quantifying them, while chapter \ref{chap:containmentBasics} explains different methods of disease control as well as the strategies as they will be applied in order to control BVD.
